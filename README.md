# Create an economic sim then mix that up with some fun fantasy/steampunk tropes

Fix value of a given city-states currency to the average productivity of its workers (1 bobin = 1 workers productivity per day)
Average productivity goes up with capital investment
Unspent money is either invested in capital, or saved
Government imposes a flat tax on its citizenry that is collected into its treasurey
Governments have control of various resources
    * Power crystals
    * Food
    * Material (Glass for most everything and metal as a special resource? I was pretty into this idea at one point)
        * For production of housing and consumer goods and weapons etc.
Whether investment is being made in a given resource is determined by the demand for that resource
Governnments have the ability to directly invest in a business, but are responsible for the capital maintainance, but also garner a share of the profits
The extemremely wealthy act much like governments, but with a markup on weapons
The black market acquires all the sir-charges associated with illegal activity (fleshed out later mayhaps)
As a rule of thumb, each positive increment costs twice as much
    * A 3 story building costs 8 times as much as a one story building
